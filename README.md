Final Year Project Ideas â€“ Computer Science
1. Blockchain-Based Secure Voting System
Overview
A decentralized voting system that uses blockchain technology to ensure secure, transparent, and tamper-proof elections.
Key Features
â€¢	Immutable Voting Records: Each vote is recorded as a transaction on the blockchain, making it unchangeable.
â€¢	Voter Authentication: Uses cryptographic keys (e.g., Ethereum wallets) to verify voter identity.
â€¢	Real-Time Results: Votes are counted instantly, eliminating delays and manual errors.
â€¢	Audit Trail: Anyone can verify votes without revealing voter identities.
Tech Stack
â€¢	Blockchain Platform: Ethereum (Solidity) or Hyperledger Fabric.
â€¢	Frontend: React.js for admin and voter interfaces.
â€¢	Backend: Node.js with Web3.js to interact with the blockchain.
â€¢	Database: IPFS for decentralized storage of voter metadata.
Future Scope
â€¢	Mobile Voting: Integrate biometric authentication for remote voting.
â€¢	Smart Contract Upgrades: Support for ranked-choice or proportional voting systems.
â€¢	Government Adoption: Pilot testing in local elections for scalability.

3. AI Healthcare Chatbot for Disease Prediction
Overview
A multi-modal chatbot that analyzes symptoms (text) and images (rashes/X-rays) to predict diseases and recommend solutions.
Key Features
â€¢	Symptom Analysis: Uses NLP models (BERT/MedNLI) to interpret text input.
â€¢	Image Diagnosis: Employs CNN (TensorFlow/PyTorch) for skin diseases or injuries.
â€¢	Doctor Recommendations: Suggests specialists based on severity.
â€¢	Data Privacy: Ensures HIPAA compliance for sensitive health data.
Tech Stack
â€¢	Frontend: Flutter for cross-platform mobile apps.
â€¢	Backend: FastAPI (Python) with Firebase integration.
â€¢	AI Models: Hugging Face (NLP), OpenCV (image processing).
â€¢	Cloud Storage: AWS S3 for secure image storage.
Future Scope
â€¢	Telemedicine API: Direct video calls with doctors via Zoom/WhatsApp.
â€¢	Wearable Integration: Syncs with Fitbit/Apple Health for real-time monitoring.
â€¢	Epidemic Tracking: Aggregates anonymized data for public health alerts.
